#India 'not forthcoming' on resuming comprehensive dialogue, Pakistan envoy at UN#NEW YORK: India is "not forthcoming" in resuming comprehensive dialogue  with Pakistan and such an attitude is "impeding" prospects of normalization of bilateral relations, Pakistan's envoy to the UN has said.Pakistan's permanent representative to the UN ambassador Maleeha Lodhi told a group of students and faculty members from the US Army War College last week that despite a positive start following the coming to power of the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India suspended talks between the two countries on "flimsy grounds and set unacceptable pre-conditions" for their revival.According to a news release by the Pakistan mission at the UN, Lodhi said in spite of Pakistan's call to resume broad-based, comprehensive dialogue, "India was still not forthcoming"."This attitude was impeding prospects of normalization between the two countries," the release said.Lodhi said that defeating terrorism, growing the economy and building a peaceful neighbourhood were among Pakistan's top priorities, including promoting peace and security in Afghanistan and normalizing relations with India on the basis of resolution of outstanding disputes."These national priorities frame our international diplomacy and our foreign engagements," she said.Lodhi further said one of Pakistan's key priorities was regional connectivity and integration and cited the connectivity project with China linking the two countries through an economic corridor."The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that would link Pakistan to Central Asia and the Eurasian landmass will not be confined to China and Pakistan but will be win-win for the entire region," the release said.
