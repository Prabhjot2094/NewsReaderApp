#Gujarat gets new CM: Call from Delhi changed script#GANDHINAGAR: It was an unexpected climax to the drama over the selection of Gujarat's new chief minister on Friday. A 20-minute phone call - received some time during the closed-door meeting held at the state BJP HQ, Shri Kamalam - apparently cut off the chances of Nitin Patel, who was till 3.30 pm the most likely successor to Anandiben Patel.Sources in the BJP said that the party leadership's decision to make Vijay Rupani the chief minister and to appoint Nitin Patel as his deputy was a compromise to quell tensions between Anandiben and BJP national president Amit Shah. Shah was present at the meeting with Rupani (the state BJP head at the time) and senior party figures such as Nitin Gadkari and the BJP's representative in charge of Gujarat affairs, Dinesh Sharma. The party's national joint general secretary, V Satish; Nitin Patel; and Saroj Pandey also attended the meeting. Anandiben arrived some 20 minutes late.Sources said an argument broke out between Shah and Anandiben over the choice of the CM. "While Anandiben blamed Rupani for causing serious problems for her govern ment, Shah defended him robustly ," a source said. Just as tension was about to explode, Satish received a phone call from Delhi -believed to be from the PMO. Satish exited the room. It was about 5pm when he returned. After another 20 minutes, the name of the new CM was announced to the BJP MLAs assembled in the hall.
