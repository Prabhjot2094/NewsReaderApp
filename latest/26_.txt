#Transactions worth crores in names of two BPL workers in MP#KATNI (MADHYA PRADESH): The police in this district of Madhya Pradesh is probing shadow bank accounts in the name of two daily wage workers that saw transactions worth crores of rupees before the Income Tax (I-T) department wised up to them.Kotwali police station in-charge S P S Baghel said on Saturday that Rajnish Tiwari and Uma Dutt Haldkar of Katni district have incomes that place them below the poverty line (BPL), but have been made, unknown to them, directors of companies."As an electrician, Tiwari earns no more than Rs 200 a day. A bank account was opened in his name that cites him as the director of a company. This account saw transactions amounting to Rs 16.93 crore from 2006 to 2010," Baghel said.He said Tiwari learnt about the account when he received a notice from the I-T department for not disclosing the source of income as reflected in the high-value transactions.Haldkar had a similar experience, having learnt about being made a company director engaging in transactions amounting to Rs 2.27 crore.The two have since filed complaints with the police, stating that they have nothing to do with the companies and the bank accounts in question, Baghel said.Money in the two accounts has been withdrawn from various parts of the country.The police is investigating whether the fake accounts have anything to do with the thriving illegal mining business in Mahakaushal region in which Katni district falls.
