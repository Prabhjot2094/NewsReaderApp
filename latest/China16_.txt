Wang would try to make efforts aimed at ensuring that Prime Minister Narendra Modi do not join other countries in raising the controversial issue of South China Sea during the upcoming G20 meeting in early September.China is extremely worried that several countries including the United States would raise the issue after an international tribunal rejecting Beijing's claims over ownership of much of the sea area recently. The ruling came after Philippines challenged Beijing's claim over much of the sea area at a tribunal constituted under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Seas.

Japan's stance is precisely the same as that of the US, as if they have discussed their lines," it said.The tabloid daily said that on the contrary the attitude of the Philippines - which filed the petition against China at the tribunal - is relatively mild as it called for restraint.Part of the ruling Communist Party publications, the daily is known of its nationalistic rhetoric."An old Chinese saying goes 'the emperor doesn't worry but his eunuch does,' meaning the outsider is more anxious than the player. In this case, Washington and Tokyo are the worrying eunuchs," it said."The calls for the use of force have only been heard when the US clamoured to safeguard the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, which mirrors that the US hasn't made the determination to use the arbitration for a showdown with China in the waters.""The People's Liberation Army should enhance its military deployment in the waters of the Nansha Islands (Spratly islands) and be fully prepared to counterattack if the US makes further provocations," it said."We do not wish for any direct confrontation or friction between the military powers... But if Washington insists on doing so, we will never flinch," the editorial said.It said many Chinese scholars believe that after the final award, the issue will gradually cool down. If there are no big moves from Manila, Washington and Tokyo, the case will "literally become nothing but a piece of paper," it said.The strongly-worded editorial came as China asserted that it would not abide by the verdict, which quashed its claims on parts of the South China Sea on the basis of historic rights.China on Wednesday flew two civilian aircraft to assert its claims to the artificial islands built in the disputed area.It successfully tested two new airfields on the disputed islands with civil flights a day after an international tribunal struck down Beijing's claims over the region.With this the number of airfields open to civil aircraft has gone up to three, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.China claims almost all of the South China Sea over which the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have rival claims.Another state-run newspaper 'China Daily' called the verdict a "travesty of international justice". "Washington has been so uneasy, and eager to contain China's rise. All the fanfare stirred up in the South China Sea, in essence, is part of that strategy," it said.

As a State Party to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of Sea (UNCLOS), India urges all parties to show utmost respect for the UNCLOS, which establishes the international legal order of the seas and oceans," the ministry of external affairs said in a statement.India supports freedom of navigation and over flight, and unimpeded commerce, based on the principles of international law, as reflected notably in the UNCLOS, the statement said.India believes that States should resolve disputes through peaceful means without threat or use of force and exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that could complicate or escalate disputes affecting peace and stability, it further said. Earlier today, the Permanent Court of Arbitration said in a statement that there was no legal basis for China to claim historic rights within the sea areas falling within the 'nine-dash line'.China "neither accepts nor recognises" the ruling of the tribunal in the SCS arbitration established at the request of the Philippines, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in Beijing."The award is null and void and has no binding force," it said in a statement minutes after the tribunal delivered its judgement striking down Beijing's claims of historic rights over the area, strongly disputed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.The US has also urged all parties to accept the tribunal's ruling saying it's "final and legally binding.""The decision today by the Tribunal in the Philippines-China arbitration is an important contribution to the shared goal of a peaceful resolution to disputes in the South China Sea," State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. Pakistan, however, backed its "all-weather" ally China and said Islamabad opposes any imposition of "unilateral will" on others.Pakistan maintains that disputes over the South China Sea (SCS) should be peacefully resolved through consultations and negotiations by states directly concerned in accordance with bilateral agreements and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Nafees Zakaria said."Pakistan opposes any imposition of unilateral will on others and respects China's statement of optional exception in light of Article 298 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea," Zakaria said.
