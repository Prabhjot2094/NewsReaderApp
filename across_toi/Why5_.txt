Why napping is good for your health#Why napping is good for your health#Not everyone is lucky enough to be able to catch a nap in the middle of the day. Busy schedules, tight deadlines and increasing stress levels leave people with little time to do anything, much less take a nap. An increasing number of experts though are agreeing that short daytime naps can actually be beneficial for your health. Here's how...  - A small 10 or 15 minute power nap can revive your energy levels. That small break is enough for the mind to slow down and regroup. - Daytime naps can turn into full-blown siestas if you suffer from insomnia, so it's best not to sleep during the day if you have trouble sleeping at night. - Napping is also said to improve your levels of concentration and alertness. So, if you can manage a couple of minutes before an important pitch or phone call, you might just perform better, say some studies. - Taking a nap for some time will also improve your mood and lower fatigue. - The place you take a nap is also important. It is unlikely that you will wake up feeling refreshed if you're surrounded by nonstop chatter or noise while you attempt to take a nap. - Certain studies also say that napping helps avoid feeling drowsiness at the wheel. Numerous accidents have happened because of falling asleep while driving. - Napping is also said to reduce your stress levels and keep your heart healthy.
