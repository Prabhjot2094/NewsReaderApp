March saw sharp gains of 10.75% in the Nifty, on account of strong flows from FIIs.  As per distributors, money continued to flow in through SIPs into mutual funds, with lump sums coming largely into ELSS funds for tax savings on account of it being the last month of the financial year.  Among banking stocks, fund managers continued to prefer retail banks over their corporate peers and continued to add  HDFC Bank to their portfolio.  Fund managers trimmed their positions in  Infosys and  Tech Mahindra on fears that growth is likely to be slow in the US and European  markets.  In the pharma space, funds added  Lupin and  Cipla, post the sharp correction in Lupin after it received nine observations on its Goa plant from the US FDA.
