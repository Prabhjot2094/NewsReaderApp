How these Chief Sustainability Officers are leading Tatas, Birlas and M&M deeper into their journey14 Apr, 2016 08:59 AM ISTWhen three large Indian business groups with a combined turnover exceeding $ 165 bn begin to address an issue it moves the needle.#How these Chief Sustainability Officers are leading Tatas, Birlas and M&M deeper into their journey#When three large Indian business groups - the Tatas, Aditya Birla and the Mahindras - with a combined turnover exceeding $ 165 billion begin to address an issue it moves the needle.  These Groups are absorbing and putting into practice the rapidly evolving tenets of  sustainability in a more pervasive, deeper and meaningful manner than ever before. And with it, Indian companies are competing with their global peers in turning the world into a better place to live in, with varying degrees of success.  That sustainability, separate from CSR or corporate philanthropy, is finally coming out of the shadows in India is also bared by the manner in which competing companies are coming together to address sustainability challenges facing an entire industry sector; like the Sustainable Housing Leadership Consortium. The consortium is expected to catalyse action to render at least 20 per cent of new housing construction sustainable by 2022 through green certification and other measures.  Much of the excitement in this space is being driven by the first crop of corporate India's chief sustainability officers (CSOs) in their own unique ways and approaches, given the dynamics of the group they are in, their personal beliefs and the challenges on hand.          Our cos to engage on circularity:  Shankar Venkateswaran, Chief, Tata Sustainability Group  Ahead of the 2015 Climate Conference in Paris, insiders suggested to Cyrus P Mistry, Chairman of the $ 108 billion Tata Group that he sign the 'Paris Pledge for Action Petition' crafted by the CEO Climate Leaders. Mistry was hesitant.  Hesitant, not because he didn't want to commit his businesses to climate action but because he abhors high- optics approaches to issues. Mistry roots for a quiet meeting of goals and targets. Mukund Rajan, member of the Group Executive Council (GEC) of Tata Sons had to muster all his persuasion skills to get the chairman to sign up. Mukund, the Tata brand custodian and chief ethics officer also oversees the sustainability function.  "This is how we are," says Shankar Venkateswaran, alluding to the muted, yet considerable work that is on, across Tata companies. He joined the Group only in 2014 and has, evidently, absorbed its values.  Shankar comes to the Group with over three decades in developmental and business consulting work- from Action Aid to pwc - even serving as India head of the London-based SustainAbility, the strategy consulting firm of John Elkington, who coined the term 'triple- bottom-line,' years ago.  He was also on the drafting committee which drew out the National Voluntary Guidelines (NVGs) on corporate responsibility. It's being updated now.  Many of his colleagues and peers in industry consider Shankar to harbour a social or a society bias. 'Business and society' has remained an area of abiding interest through much of his career. In a way, it's in consonance with the Tata world view.  The attitude also reflects in the Tata Group Sustainability Policy announced in mid- 2015 which, among other things, not only embeds a product life- cycle approach to sustainability but also,very boldly, commits to natural and social capital valuation.  "Next year on we want to engage with our companies on circularity," reveals Shankar. Circularity addresses the limitations of the traditional, linear model of consumption and is the latest in sustainability thinking. A circular economy or model revolves around resource constraints and primarily attempts to 'design out' waste.  Shankar has been lucky as circumstances helped him cobble a group-wide sustainability mechanism with considerable ease immediately on joining; else to conjure a system to address 100 independent operating companies, 20 of which are listed, and present in 100 countries across six contents, could have been daunting indeed.  Things fell in place: those at the helm of the Tata Council for Community Initiatives (TCCI), largely the CSR arm of the Tata's, were retiring; the environment sustainability group housed in Tata Quality Management Services (TQMS) was ready to move out and claim independent status. TQMS is a crucible of sorts within the Group to test out ideas and innovations.   TCCI and the enviro group were quickly merged to form the Tata Sustainability Group (TSG) to provide thought leadership in this space.  Tata Relief, the Group's disaster response initiative,was also brought under its ambit.  A geographic structure too emerged in the form of a Global Sustainability Council, chaired by MukundRajan and 15 CEOs as members including those of Tata Steel Europe and JLR. Regional sustainability working committees (SWCs) - India, Africa, South-east Asia & China complete the picture. Global flows of ideas are now happening. The circularity initiative, for instance, draws on the considerable work done by JLR.  The Tata Trusts, the philanthropic arm of the Group, which has also been re-inventing itself after Ratan Tata took over its reins, is now engaging with initiatives within the Group and also outside. A renewed focus on collaborations is quite evident.  Conversations are beginning to happen during the curation of developmental or CSR initiatives. The Trusts, when seeking tech solutions, now reach out to Tata companies. "The engagement with the Trusts has its creative tensions too," says Shankar, "but now we are thinking together."          Demystify Sustainability:  Anirban Ghosh, Vice President, Group Sustainability, Mahindra & Mahindra  Early this year, when the Mahindra Group unveiled petrol engine vehicles within a couple of months of the ban on big diesel vehicles in Delhi, it took the establishment by surprise. How did this blitzkrieg-like response come about? Only insiders know that it emerged from an intense scenario planning engagement of years within the Group centred on sustainability and the future of mobility.  Over the past eight years, the $ 16.9 billion Mahindra Group has evolved into a business entity with a remarkable degree of sustainability thinking. Petrol and smaller diesel engines, expectedly, were already in the works.  And it helps if the person driving Group sustainability, Anirban Ghosh, earned his spurs in sales, marketing, and importantly, strategy. Anirban, on his return to India, after a harrowing stint in the US, leading the tractor business, during the 2008 financial crisis, has been pivotal in the creating the Group's agri vertical.  "My approach to sustainability is not from an activists' perspective. It comes from hard-core business," says Anirban. The Group, seen as a federation of companies, has notched remarkable progress in the usual indicators: water conservation, waste management, and energy efficiency. The Group has signed up for EP 100 of the Climate Group to double energy productivity by 2030. "Energy efficiency gives us greater and faster returns than many of the products we invest in," he explains.  Chairman Anand Mahindra champions sustainability and also recently signed up to the global Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition. The tone from the top is critical. Anand is slowly acquiring a sustainability mien. He says: "Our effort to erase the perceived dichotomy between sustainability and profits is paying rich dividends."  Apart from quickly plucking the lowhanging fruit in sustainability, the Group is seriously looking at greening its portfolio. Micro irrigation, solar, electric vehicles are coming centrestage. It's around half a billion dollars turnover already and is expected to double in five years, if not earlier. The runaway success of the recent global launch of the Model 3 electric car by Tesla and its intention to come to India is a good augury. Mahindra acquired Reva Electric Car Co. in 2010.  How did Anirban and the Group's Sustainability Council, take the agenda across its 28 varied businesses? It has been a mix of evangelism and a nudge with processes. All CEOs are encouraged to lay out a path to sustainability for which a dashboard has been created. The dashboard is re-configured every six months and displays each company's progress.  Anirban often pitches in with the 'business case;' critical for convincing reluctant CEOs, showing how adoption will increase their profitability. Sustainability is now also integral to the Mahindra way- basically a TQM process spread across all group businesses.  He has, in a way, simplified or demystified sustainability for seniors within the Group as many hail from a generation or ecosystem not attuned to sustainability thinking. "It's spoonfeeding," says Anirban, "you plug it into a process and CEOs learn from it."  The proliferation of sustainability thinking is evident by the response of Group companies. Anita Arjundas of Mahindra Lifespace Developers, for instance, began looking for a replacement to sand that is rapaciously mined, destroying riverine ecosystems. She now supports many entrepreneurs who supply her co. with 'manufactured-sand.' "The switch has also impacted project efficiency significantly," says Anita.  Anirban, meanwhile, is battling a particular challenge which many sustainability professionals also face. 'How do I communicate sustainability to individuals, to employees, to consumers?'  This is the question that bedevils him. He made a small dent last year when he announced a scheme to refund electricity bills to employees who showed a dip in power consumption at home over a six month period. The response is muted but converts are emerging.â€‹   It's All About Change in Mindset: Tony Henshaw, Chief Sustainability Officer, Aditya Birla Group     The $ 41 billion  Aditya Birla Group may be seen as a novice in meshing sustainability into its business goals and processes. It's true; only partly.  The conglomerate, with a presence in 36 countries, has just about begun to address sustainability issues in a strategic and structured manner. Yet, one of its companies, the Atlanta- based Novelis is being celebrated for its remarkable foray into 'circularity' - the very cutting edge of the global sustainability debate.  Novelis, a leader in rolled aluminium products, has so transformed its business model that its dependence on bauxite mining and primary aluminium is dropping rapidly. Its recycled inputs for the last quarter of 2015 were 53 per cent. For the year, the co. purchased over 50 billion used beverage cans to feed it plants. This is what Tony Henshaw calls 'future proofing' a business or its supply chain in a situation when the world is inexorably moving towards a serious resource crunch.  He is of the opinion, in a generic sense, that supply chains of many businesses are 'built on sand.' They can crumble with the slightest of disturbance. Tony is seeking to build value chains erected on 'concrete foundations.' For a conglomerate like Aditya Birla which is commodities-heavy it makes eminent sense.  Tony hails from the UK and has been all over the world; cleaning up oil spills in Bolivia at a Shell joint venture, negotiating with indigenous communities, working on forest conservation with a gas pipeline company to commissioning mass transit trains in Seoul and Portugal. In many of his assignments he has had 'antagonistic experiences' and was mostly engaged in fire-fighting of sorts. He is now happy to function from a stable Indian platform.  "Our models will have to involve stakeholders and make investments in value chains even if the payback may not be as high as we think it ought to be," explains Tony alluding to the grief that many global companies have come to recently including auto giant  Volkswagen. "If we don't do this, the alternative could be worse."  Tony joined the Aditya Birla Group in 2013 from the mining major Vedanta Resources plc, and is now engaging with Birla companies that are in various stages of sustainability evolution- from Novelis at the tip of the spearhead to some still trying to align themselves with international standards in sustainability.  According to the framework he has crafted for the Group, he describes the first step in the sustainability journey as 'responsible stewardship' which is largely complying with laws and rules. Then comes the 'stakeholder engagement' stage where companies acquire the 'ability to understand how fast things will change and where business disruptions will occur.'  And finally, the 'future-proofing stage,' where companies stay ahead of major trend curves. Bulk of the Birla companies, he concedes, is in the middle level.  A group sustainability committee is already in place. Every business in the Group now has a sustainability committee chaired by respective CEOs. A group-wide IT system, christened, Enablon, has already been rolled out to 200 sites. "It will allow us to start or refine sustainability reporting," says Tony.  He insists that much of sustainability is about mind-set change. The question to be asked is - is your mind open to the fact that the world will change. Tony has been asking questions of CEOs within the Group. Every Tuesday at 5.30 pm, since the last two years, a webinar on sustainability, with participation from all group companies happen without fail.  Meanwhile, the Group is beginning to take leadership strides; the world's largest producer of viscose staple fibre and yarn now wants to eliminate wood sourced from endangered forests.  Says Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla: "We are excited to help drive innovation in the development of fabrics made from new fibres that reduce the pressure on the world's natural forests."  When a company responsible for over 20 per cent of the world's viscose makes a commitment like this, the industry's supply chain goes into upheaval, for the good.
