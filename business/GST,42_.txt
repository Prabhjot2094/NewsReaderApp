Yet, as many as 30 BSE500 stocks offered returns in excess of 100 per cent during this period. Data available with corporate database Capitaline showed at least seven BSE500 stocks gave returns anywhere between 200 per cent and 365 per cent against a 5 per cent rise in the BSE Sensex.     Almost all of these stocks belonged to sectors that have substantial exposure to the domestic economy.     Gayatri Projects, which has interests in infrastructure, power, hospitality and real estate, has gained 366 per cent since May 7, 2015. Low-cost carrier SpiceJet, which reported a net profit of Rs 407 crore for FY16, has soared 261 per cent. CPCL, a subsidiary of state-run IOC, has climbed 241 per cent.     Shares of cement maker Dalmia Bharat, textile firm Himatsingka Seide, commodity chemicals firm GHCL and sugar producer Balrampur Chini have grown between 220 per cent and 236 per cent during this period.     The bill, touted as the biggest reform since Independence, got approval of the Lower House last year with 352 members voting in favour of it while 37 went against it.     The government move to drop certain terms, which were a bone of contention between it and the Opposition parties, at last paved the way for unanimous approval to the bill from the Upper House on August 3.     "This has been a transformational journey in GST. Finally, we have done it. What can be a better time than this, because a good monsoon is also with us this year. Structurally everything looks great for India. The GST will benefit auto, auto components, multiplexes, cement, plywood, logistics and many other sectors," said Parag Thakkar, Head of Institutional Sales, HDFC Securities     "From a near- term perspective, you can say that the market has priced in the event in terms of multiples. But from a longer-term structural point of view, all this definitely remains a great buying story. On dips, when people book profit, as we are seeing in most of these sectors that would benefit from the GST, it would be good buying opportunity," Thakkar said.     Nilkamal, Kwality, Dishman Pharma, Manappuran Finance, Bajaj Finance, Godrej Phillips, Minda Industries and Escorts are some of the other stocks that generated over 100 per cent return during the these 15 months.
