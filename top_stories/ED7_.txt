ED seeks non-bailable warrant against Mallya
#MEA suspends Vijay Mallya's passport on advice of Enforcement Directorate#NEW DELHI: The external affairs ministry has suspended loans defaulter Vijay Mallya's diplomatic passport on the advice of the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Further, the ED, which is probing money laundering charges against the 60-year-old liquor baron, today moved a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Mumbai seeking a non-bailable warrant against him in connection with a Rs 900 crore IDBI loan fraud case.Mallya, who's been in Britain for over a month, is facing legal proceedings for the alleged default of loans worth over Rs 9,000 crores from various banks. He was supposed to present himself before the ED's investigators in Mumbai on Saturday in connection with a money laundering probe in the more than Rs 900 crore IDBI loan fraud case.In fact, the ED had asked that the liquor baron's passport be revoked for non-cooperation with investigators, after he failed to present himself before the agency that has summoned him three times.The ED has registered a money laundering case against Mallya and others, based on an FIR registered last year by the CBI. The agency is also investigating the financial structure of the now defunct Kingfisher Airlines and is looking into any payment of kickbacks it made to secure loan the loan.Mallya was first summoned by the agency to "appear in person" at its office in Mumbai on March 18 but he sought more time citing his prior engagements, following which the agency asked him to depose on April 2."On the advice of the Enforcement Directorate, the Passport Issuing Authority in the MEA has today suspended the validity of Vijay Mallya's diplomatic passport with immediate effect for a period of 4 weeks, under Section 10 A of the Passports Act, 1967."Mallya has been asked to respond within one week as to why his passport should not be impounded or revoked under section 10(3)(c) of the Passports Act, 1967. If he fails to respond within the stipulated time, it will be assumed that he has no response to offer and the MEA will go ahead with the revocation," MEA spokesman Vikas Swarup said.It was noted that despite summons by ED to Mallya to join investigations on March 10 and 15 as also April 2, he was deliberately avoiding his personal appearance, which is a statutory requirement before the agency, in defiance of due procedures.Several aspects of irregularities and criminal misconduct allegedly committed by Mallya including his role in the offence of money laundering have come to surface, the sources said, adding that they are under investigation by multiple agencies.Thus, his failure to appear before the investigating authority under Prevention of Money Laundering Act is tantamount to wilful non-compliance and intended to deliberately scuttle the process of investigation.Against this background, the ED moved the MEA for revocation of his passport. The sources said the government is committed to brining to book wilful defaulters and to recover public money from them.While the loans issue is being investigated by CBI on charges of criminal misappropriation, criminal conspiracy and under the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Serious Fraud Investigation Office is probing violations under the Companies Act and the ED under PMLA.In Mumabi, an ED official said, "We have moved the court seeking NBW against him and the hearing is likely to take place tomorrow."
