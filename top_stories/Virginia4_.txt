  RIO DE JANEIRO: American teenager Virginia Thrasher claimed the first Rio Olympics gold medal in the shooting on Saturday.
  

  The 19-year-old won the women's 10m air rifle title at the Deodoro shooting venue, holding her nerve to see off China's Du Li on the final shot.
  

  She finished with 208 points, one clear of 2004 Athens champion Du as Olympic chief Thomas Bach looked on in the crowd.
  

  The bronze medal went to China's defending champion Yi Siling.
