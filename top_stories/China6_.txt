#China's air force flies combat patrol over disputed South China Sea#BEIJING: China's air force sent bombers and fighter jets on "combat patrols" near contested islands in the BACKGROUNDXExplained: The South China Sea disputeJudges at an arbitration tribunal in The Hague on Tuesday rejected China's claims to economic rights across large swathes of the South China Sea in a ruling that will be claimed as a victory by the Philippines. Here is what the dispute was all about: What is the dispute about?Approximately 3.5 million square km area of the South China Sea has been under dispute as China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have all claimed sovereignty over this territory. This area of the sea is rich in oil and gas fields. China has backed its territorial claim by building on these islands and running naval patrols near them. While the US says it is not taking any side in the argument, it has sent military ships and planes to the area, which has irked China.Both China and the US have accused each other of "militarising" the South China Sea.What does China say?China claims the waters saying the area is within its "nine-dash line", which extends hundreds of miles to the south and east of its island province of Hainan. Nine-dash lines are the dashes that demarcate virtually all of the South China Sea as Chinese territory, under the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Seas, or UNCLOS.China has been taking what analysts say are "passive-aggressive" steps, which is to use fishing vessels and oil rigs to change the status quo on the ground and assert sovereignty over the area.China has reiterated time and again that it has had rights to the territories for centuries, a claim that is contested by Vietnam and Taiwan.The case of PhilippinesChina wants to negotiate directly with the Philippines and each of the four other claimants in an arrangement that would give it leverage for its sheer size and influence. Beijing has steadfastly opposed bringing the disputes to an international arena, which could provide the US a chance to intervene.The Philippines asked a tribunal of five arbitrators to declare as invalid China's vast claims using the "nine-dash line". However, China and the Philippines are among more than 160 signatories of the 1982 convention, regarded as the constitution that governs and stipulates the rights of countries in using the world's oceans.Still, the Philippines asked the tribunal to classify whether a number of disputed areas could be called islands, low-tide coral outcrops or submerged banks. That's so it can be determined whether China is indeed entitled to the stretch of territorial waters under the convention. It also wants China to be declared in violation of the convention for carrying out fishing and construction activities that breached the Philippines' maritime rights. The convention does not deal with sovereignty questions, which the Philippine government says it did not raise.With China's claims, the Philippines stands to lose a huge chunk of off-shore territory, said Antonio Carpio, an associate Supreme Court justice who has made extensive studies on the conflicts, to Reuters. ``This Chinese aggression is the gravest external threat to the Philippines since World War II,'' he said.What is India's stand ?India's discomfort has increased sharply because New Delhi finds that what China is doing in the South China Sea is being replicated in spirit and tactics on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which goes through territory claimed by India. While India does not want to escalate tensions by challenging China on the South China Sea, it worries whether anybody will support India's stand on CPEC.China has declared via its state media outlets that India is sympathetic to China's view, and its joint statement with India and Russia affirms it. Meanwhile, US Pacific Command chief, Admiral Harris indicated India and US may soon be sailing together for joint patrols, as part of a roadmap of the Strategic Vision document signed when Barack Obama visited India in 2015. In recent days, reports said India and US were discussing working together to track submarines and on anti-submarine warfare, a move clearly aimed at China.What are other countries saying about it?Most countries have generally taken a position on the arbitration case depending on whether they're aligned with the US or China.The diplomatic tug-of-war has put smaller countries and regional blocs in a dilemma, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, whose four member states are claimants.A Philippine push for the 10-nation bloc to issue a joint statement calling for China to respect Tuesday's ruling has stalled with Cambodia and Laos backing the Chinese position. Besides the Philippines and Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore have also been wary of China.The regional group has a bedrock principle of deciding by consensus, meaning just one member state can stall any group effort.The US, Britain and the rest of the EU support the arbitration.China claims support of some 40-60 nations, including many landlocked African nations and Pacific islands where Beijing has economic clout.(With inputs from Agencies) RELATED STORIESSouth China Sea+ , in a move a senior colonel said was part of an effort to normalize such drills and respond to security threats.The exercises come at a time of heightened tension in the disputed waters after an arbitration court in The Hague ruled last month that China did not have historic rights to the South China Sea.The air force sent several H-6 bombers and Su-30 fighter jets to inspect the airspace around the Spratly Islands and Scarborough Shoal, Senior Colonel Shen Jinke of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force said, according to state news agency Xinhua.The patrols included surveillance and refuelling aircraft, Xinhua said, although it did not say when they occurred."The Air Force is organizing normalized South China Sea combat patrols, practising tactics ... increasing response capabilities to all kinds of security threats and safeguarding national sovereignty, security and maritime interests," Shen said.China has refused to recognize the ruling by an arbitration court in The Hague that BACKGROUNDXBeijing says won't accept South China Sea verdict, state-run media calls tribunal 'ridiculous'File photo of Chinese President Xi JinpingNEW DELHI: China has said it neither accepts nor recognizes The Hague tribunal's verdict against its claims to territories in the South China Sea . That was expected. But that China would heap abuses on the tribunal was perhaps not expected.Through its state-run news agency Xinhua, China has called the case - now won by the Philippines - a "farce". Xinhua cited "experts" as saying the tribunal was "illegal and ridiculous because of the questionable selection of its members and its flawed jurisdictional findings".The tribunal in The Hague on Tuesday rejected China's claims to economic rights across large swathes of the South China Sea in a ruling that will be claimed as a victory by the Philippines.China's President Xi Jinping used more measured language in his response to the media. However, he has his state-run media at his disposal to say what his government really thinks. China "is dedicated to maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea but will not accept any positions or actions based on the outcome of the arbitration case over the dispute," Xi told Reuters."The award is null and void and has no binding force," the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement. What Chinese media saysThe state-run media's article says a lot more.China believes "the selection of the members of the tribunal is questionable" and that it was "biased", Xinhua writes. The tribunal, established by the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration, doesn't think so. "There was no legal basis for China to claim historic rights to resources within the sea areas falling within the 'nine-dash line'," the court said, referring to a demarcation line on a 1947 map of the sea, which is rich in energy, mineral and fishing resources.Tribunal is biased, says ChinaThe state-run Xinhua quoted Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi as saying the arbitration case has put the dispute into the dangerous territory of worsening tensions and confrontation.China says the tribunal's members were biased "as most of them were picked by Shunji Yanai, then ITLOS (the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea) president and former Japanese ambassador to the United States," Xinhua writes.China's state-run media agency goes on to describe Yanai as a "famous Japanese right-winger" and adds that his creation of the arbitral tribunal "is believed to be biased as he initially picked Judge Chris Pinto of Sri Lanka" as a tribunal member. And that was a problem, Xinhua writes, because Pinto's wife is a Filipino national.Xinhua's report does say that Pinto was later replaced in the tribunal by a Ghanain judge, but despite that the tribunal was biased. The other judges were France, Poland, the Netherlands and Germany."He (Wanai) assembled five lawyers of international law into a biased arbitral tribunal, which is tilted toward the Philippines and ignored what China stands for," Chinese Ambassador to The Netherlands Wu Ken is quoted as saying.With inputs from Agencies RELATED STORIESinvalidated its vast territorial claims+ in the South China Sea and did not take part in the proceedings brought by the BACKGROUNDXPhilippines 'welcomes' South China Sea rulingMANILA: The Philippines welcomed a ruling by a UN-backed tribunal today that declares China has no "historic rights" in the South China Sea, Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay said, as he urged restraint."The Philippines welcomes the issuance today... on the arbitration proceedings initiated by the Philippines with regard to the South China Sea," Yasay told reporters minutes after the court in The Hague released its verdict.The Permanent Court of Arbitration said the tribunal ruled there was no legal basis for China to claim "historic rights" to resources within the South China Sea falling within its claimed nine-dash line, which is based on a Chinese map dating back to the 1940s."Our experts are studying the award with the care and thoroughness that this significant arbitral outcome deserves.
